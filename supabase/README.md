# Supabase Migrations

This directory is the source of truth for Movie Bowl database schema and RLS policy changes.

## One-time setup

1. Install the Supabase CLI.
2. Link this repo to your existing Supabase project:

```bash
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

3. Pull your current remote schema as a baseline migration:

```bash
supabase db pull
```

Commit the generated migration before making new DB changes.

## Ongoing workflow

1. Create a new migration:

```bash
supabase migration new short_description
```

2. Add SQL changes (tables, constraints, indexes, RLS, policies).
3. Apply to remote:

```bash
supabase db push
```

4. Commit migration files to git.

## Drift rule

Avoid dashboard-only schema/policy changes. If an emergency dashboard edit happens, immediately backfill it into a migration file and commit.
